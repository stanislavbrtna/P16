## P16View

This is gui viewer for P16 images, it uses SDL2 for gui stuff and basic SDA filesystem library for file access (so the drawing code could be same as in SDA_OS). It's quite simple thing, maximum image size is hardcoded to 1024x1024px.

### How to compile
If you have SDL2 dev packages installed, simply make. Test file is provided in bin/Images folder.

### How to use
Executable takes the image file as its first parameter.
